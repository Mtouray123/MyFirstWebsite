    <p>
        Back in high school I attended Bloomfield Tech which is a vocational school that offers instruction and practical introductory experience in skilled trades such as mechanics, welding, plumbing, hvac, carpentry, green energy, tv/production and graphic design.   
    My experiences in high school caused me to gain a extreme passion in such skilled trades thus resulting in my Enrolled at Essex County College and earned my Associates degree in Applied Sciences in Engineering. Throughout college I enrolled in a variety of different courses which introduced students to the world of innovation, design, problem and critical thinking skills. Classes revolved around the major branches of engineering; mechanical, industrial, architectural, civil, chemical, and electrical.
    I even took a few classes relating to computer programming which helped give me a better understanding of the mind and impact behind software developers.
    My AutoCad and computer programming classes intrigued me the most.
